# Library
Command Line Program, used to keep track of books and audiobooks on shelf. Think bootleg goodreads.
Used to gain experience with basic c# development.
Will update to include a gui and eventually web app features.
Users will be able to add either item to a list, remove an item from a list, edit an item, print the list, save the list or load a list.
